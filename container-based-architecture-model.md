# Container Based Architecture Model

The virtualised data centres offers infrastructure as a service(IAAS) and platforma as a service(Paas)

**IAAS** provides raw compute, storage and network more related to hardware side and ypu pay for what you allocate

**PAAS** provides a service that can bind applications to the library you writes and give access to the infrastructure that application needs and pays what you use. 
GCP took care both of them very well and you no need paty per what you use. 

***Saas** software as service is designed to consume directly by the users and best examples are Gsuite, Gmail ans so on.

**GCP services are compatiable with open source products**
